        <h1>My Name is Brandon</h1>
        <p>I've proudly dedicated over 20 years to serving the State of North Carolina, 
            beginning my career in law enforcement as a police officer before transitioning 
            into the field of information technology. My journey led me to the NC Department of 
            Public Safety, where I served as a Data Center Administrator, 
            managing critical infrastructure that supported statewide operations. Today, I continue
            that mission in a technical role with the NC State Highway Patrol, where I provide IT 
            support to enhance operational readiness and public safety communications.</p>
        <P>Throughout my career, I've remained deeply committed to public service, driven
            by a desire to solve problems, support those on the front lines, and ensure that technology
            serves as a reliable backbone for mission-critical functions. As I approach retirement,
            I'm looking forward to the next chapter, one that allows me to continue making a
            meaningful impact while embracing the opportunities that come with decades of experience
            in both law enforcement and IT.</P>
        <p>Outside of work, I have a passion for adventure motorcycles. I find freedom and clarity
            on the open road, often leading or participating in long-distance rides across the region
            with fellow riders. These journeys not only reflect my love for exploration and precision 
            but also mirror the same values I've carried throughout my career: discipline, resilience, 
            and a constant drive to push boundaries.</p>
        <p>Whether it's troubleshooting networks or navigating winding roads on my BMW GSA, I'm fueled by 
            a love for challenges and the satisfaction of overcoming them. The road ahead is still wide open, 
            and I'm ready for wherever it leads.</p>
