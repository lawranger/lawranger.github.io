## _About Me:_ 
###I’ve proudly served the State of North Carolina for over 20 years, beginning my career as a police officer before transitioning into IT as a Data Center Administrator with the NC Department of Public Safety. Currently, I’m supporting the NC State Highway Patrol in a technology role, and with retirement on the horizon, I’m looking forward to the next chapter while continuing to make a meaningful impact in public service.
